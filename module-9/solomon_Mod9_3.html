            My name is Shayna. I am from <span id="location">________</span>. I have moved around the country quite a lot, but there is no place like home, and that is where I currently live.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            I have two boys, named Noah and Asher who are my whole life. My <span id="family">________</span> are my greatest joy.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            My children are my greatest <span id="achievements">________</span>; however, I want to show them that even though I am not 18, I can still pursue and accomplish my goals by earning a degree.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            I am thankful to God and my children for their <span id="support">________</span>, and I believe that by achieving my dreams, I am setting an example of perseverance and dedication.
