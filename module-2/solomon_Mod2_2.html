        <p class="intro">My name is Shayna. I am from Miami, Florida. I have moved around the country quite a lot but there is no place like home and that is where I currently live.</p>
        <p>I have two boys, named Noah and Asher who are my whole life.</p>
        <p>My children are my greatest accomplishments; however, I want to show them that even though I am not 18, I can still pursue and accomplish my goals by earning a degree.</p>
        <p>I am thankful to God and my children for their support, and I believe that by achieving my dreams, I am setting an example of perseverance and dedication. <span class="sentence">I am thankful to God and my children for their support.</span></p>
